# Terraform

[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) allows a user to define infrastructure using version-controllable configuration files, from which the Terraform platform devises a plan for implementing that infrastructure and then executes after user approval.

Infrastructure configuration can be automatically checked to adhere to security policies.

*Modules* can be used to define a pattern that can be stored in a registry and reused across applications.

Application life cycle, from initial deployment to decommissioning, includes:

- Applying patches and vulnerability fixes.
- Right-sizing for cost and load.
- Application updates.
- Compliance and auditing.

*Packer* is used to build AWS/Azure/GCP and Docker images.
