# Software Development Methodologies

## Agile

The Agile methodology focuses on stuff working (teams, functioning software, customer relationships) more than following strict processes (business workflows, in-depth documentation, negotiating contracts).

The methodology says to be flexible to requirements changing or becoming clearer over time. It prefers this to following a plan or over-planning.

Build, test, etc. phases are concurrent. Functional software is regularly released, and each iteration builds upon the last.

## Waterfall

In the Waterfall methodology, build, test, etc. phases are sequential. Software is only delivered at the very end.
